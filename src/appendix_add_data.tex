\chapter{Additional Data}\label{ch:additional-data}

This appendix contains supplementary materials that support the AI-supported IMM artefact described in Chapters~\ref{ch:artefact-development} and \ref{ch:results}. 
It includes raw project profiles, generated KPIs, audit logs, and dashboard mock-ups.

\section*{1. Example Project Profiles}

Below are anonymized structured outputs from the \texttt{Profile} Pydantic model for two sample projects. 
These illustrate the type of information extracted from pitch decks and structured for KPI generation.

\begin{verbatim}
{
  "startup_name": "GreenFields AgTech",
  "legal_form": "GmbH",
  "founder_first_name": "Anna",
  "founder_last_name": "Schmidt",
  "founder_gender": "female",
  "startup_email": "anna@greenfields.com",
  "startup_phone": "+49 123 456 789",
  "startup_city": "Berlin",
  "startup_country": "Germany",
  "startup_postcode": "10115",
  "website": "https://greenfields.com",
  "project_beginning": "2023-03-01",
  "turnover": 250000,
  "profit": 30000,
  "employers": 5,
  "problem": "Excessive synthetic nitrogen usage in small farms",
  "vision": "Reduce fertilizer use while maintaining yields",
  "mission": "Develop sustainable precision farming tools",
  "solution": "IoT soil sensors with AI-driven recommendations",
  "social_impact": "Promote sustainable agriculture and environmental health",
  "reason": "Reduce environmental pollution and farmer costs",
  "value_1": "Sustainability",
  "value_2": "Efficiency",
  "value_3": "Innovation",
  "target_group": "Smallholder farmers in Europe"
}
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{TODO:} Add 1–2 more anonymized profiles illustrating diverse sectors and project types.

\section*{2. Generated KPIs / Indicators}

Example KPI generated from the above project profile:

\begin{verbatim}
{
  "category": "Agrar & Agrar Tech",
  "sub_category": "Sustainable Inputs",
  "goal": ["Reduce synthetic nitrogen application rate by 20 percent per hectare within 12 months among users"],
  "short_term_goal_1": "Users reduce synthetic nitrogen rate within 6 months",
  "short_term_indicator_1": "Share of users who reduced synthetic nitrogen rate compared to last season",
  "short_term_question_1": "Did you reduce your synthetic nitrogen application rate per hectare this season compared to last season?",
  "type_of_short_term_question_1": "single_choice",
  "answer_options_short_term_question_1": ["Yes", "No", "Not applicable"],
  "measurement_method_short_term_question_1": "Self-reported comparison to baseline season recorded at onboarding",
  "unit_method_short_term_question_1": "percent of users",
  "justification_method_short_term_question_1": "User-level rate reduction is an early signal of improved nutrient efficiency",
  "source_method_short_term_question_1": "IRIS+ Agrochemical Use intensity; SDG 2.4",
  "long_term_goal_1": ["Users sustain a 20 percent lower synthetic nitrogen rate after 3 seasons"],
  "long_term_indicator_1": ["Kilograms of synthetic nitrogen applied per hectare per season"],
  "long_term_question_1": "How many kilograms of synthetic nitrogen per hectare did you apply this season?",
  "type_of_long_term_question_1": "open_question",
  "measurement_method_long_term_question_1": "Farmer input logs normalized by field area",
  "unit_method_long_term_question_1": "kg N/ha",
  "justification_method_long_term_question_1": "Rate per area directly measures fertilizer pressure with strong links to cost and emissions",
  "source_method_long_term_question_1": "IRIS+ Agrochemical Use; FAO fertilizer statistics; SDG 12.4"
}
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{TODO:} Include 2–3 more KPIs per category to show coverage and variety.  
\textbf{TODO:} Add example of secondary goal handling when multiple outcomes are detected.

\section*{3. Human-in-the-Loop Audit Logs}

\begin{quote}
\textit{"Short-term indicator was slightly ambiguous; refined wording to ensure farmers understand units and target."}
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\textit{"SDG mapping verified: matches SDG 2.4 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12.4 (Responsible Consumption)"} 
\end{quote}

\textbf{TODO:} Include anonymized full audit log table showing KPI revisions, reviewer comments, and XAI trace outputs.

---

\section*{4. Dashboard Mock-Up}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{../fig/dashboard_mockup}
    \caption{Prototype Impact Dashboard Showing KPI Performance and Trends}
    \label{fig:dashboard-mockup}
\end{figure}

\textbf{TODO:} Populate dashboard with real or simulated KPI metrics.  
\textbf{TODO:} Add labels for public value dimensions, project comparisons, and trends.

---

\section*{5. Data Collection Instruments}

Example survey question derived from KPI:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Short-term KPI: Share of users who reduced synthetic nitrogen rate}  
\textbf{Question:} Did you reduce your synthetic nitrogen application rate per hectare this season compared to last season?  
\textbf{Type:} Single choice  
\textbf{Answer Options:} Yes / No / Not applicable  
\textbf{Measurement Method:} Self-reported comparison to baseline season recorded at onboarding
\end{quote}

\textbf{TODO:} Add example long-term KPI survey question.  
\textbf{TODO:} Include one qualitative open-ended question from mission/vision evaluation.

---

\section*{6. Raw Analysis Outputs}

\textbf{TODO:} Include anonymized sample outputs of KPI aggregation, summary statistics, or thematic analysis of qualitative data.  
\textbf{TODO:} Add visualizations like histograms or word clouds if available.

---

\section*{7. Ethical and Governance Documentation}

\begin{itemize}
    \item GDPR-compliant consent form template \textbf{TODO: add redacted form}.
    \item Notes on anonymization and secure storage \textbf{TODO: describe procedure}.
    \item Guidelines for human-in-the-loop oversight \textbf{TODO: include short description or table}.
\end{itemize}

\section*{8. Glossary and Abbreviations}

\begin{itemize}
    \item KPI – Key Performance Indicator  
    \item IMM – Impact Measurement and Management  
    \item SDG – Sustainable Development Goal  
    \item LLM – Large Language Model  
    \item XAI – Explainable Artificial Intelligence
